			 	<h1><strong>1.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (Valve)</strong></h1>

				<p>CS:GO  With the game currently on weekly television with TBS and Eleague, the potential growth for the title is even greater. Outside of being huge in North America, Europe and South America, the game is starting to gain traction in China, and that can only mean more money, sponsorships and eyeballs directed toward the world's top first-person shooter.</p> 

				<!--READ MORE--><p>Additionally, CS:GO's straightforward five-on-five format with clear-cut attack and defense objectives contributes to its growing popularity among spectators. This simplicity has the advantage against games with thousands of spells and different characters like League of Legends, and makes this Valve game my top pick on the board.</p>

					<h1> 2. League of Legends (Riot Games)</h1>
					<br>
					<p>League of Legends, for all its issues and complaints, is still the game that has the farthest reach when it comes to worldwide appeal. There are professional leagues for League of Legends across the globe, and it's huge in major markets like the United States, Europe and China. It has a wide array of famous players, like the Michael Jordan-esque Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok, and Riot has done a good job marketing its leagues and talent while also investing in infrastructure behind-the-scenes.

					The issue that League might run into, outside of how difficult it can be for a newcomer to understand what the hell is actually going on, is the regional parity of the competitive scene. Koreans dominate the game, and most of the top international teams in other regions have Korean imports on the roster. While nationalistic diversity isn't the be-all and end-all, the same teams from the same region winning the major tournaments every year can turn away fans from budding regions.</p>

					<h1> 3. Dota 2 (Valve)</h1>
					<br>
					<p> The second Valve game on the board, Dota 2, is a game that has staying power despite its smaller scale. Dota's greater complexity vs. League adds depth, but it also makes the game less approachable for new audiences. While Dota has significant international presence, its inability to crack key esports markets like South Korea also contributes to its ranking behind League.

					Still, Dota 2 is a safe pick as the third-biggest esport. The crowd-funded prize pools for Dota events are huge and you'll be hard-pressed to find a more loyal group of fans; add in its history in China, and I think it'll keep its spot for at least the near future.</p>

						<h1><strong> 5. Street Fighter V (Capcom)</strong></h1>
						<br>
						<p> Here comes our first fighting game on the list. Between Street Fighter V and its fellow fighting game Super Smash Bros., Street Fighter has the edge due to publisher Capcom's strong commitment to fostering a competitive scene. Capcom is throwing its financial weight behind Street Fighter, and the game, although not selling as well as the company might have hoped, is one of the best fighters ever created for esports.

						The tournament Evolution 2016 in Las Vegas this July will be the first real test to see whether the investment into Street Fighter will pay off. So far, with more than 4,000 people entering the competition, the future looks mighty bright.</p>

						<h1><strong> 6. Super Smash Bros. Melee (Nintendo)</strong></h1>
						<br>
						<p> Super Smash Bros. Melee has been around for 15 years, and it may now finally be coming into its own. Its recognizable cast of characters and colorful graphics -- eye-pleasing despite being almost two decades old -- make Melee very approachable from a spectator perspective.

						Beyond the game's history and accessibility, it's the players themselves and their interesting rivalries that drive this esport to even greater heights. Every year, the veterans of the game known as the "Five Gods" are challenged by would-be slayers of kings from all ends of the community. In an era when fans are constantly searching for the next big thing, Melee's rich history and quirky cast of characters inside and outside the game are why this 2001 title is so high up on the draft board.

						Unfortunately, publisher Nintendo is still lagging behind its counterpart Capcom when it comes to supporting Melee and other Smash games as esports. If Nintendo ever decides to close the gap, watch out -- its money and international reach could catapult Smash esports to the front of the pack.</p>
